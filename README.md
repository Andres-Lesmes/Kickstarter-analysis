# Kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
	In this project we are analyzing crowdfunding data in order to help Louise who is a new play writer. She is looking into start a crowdfunding campaign to raise over $10 thousand dollars that she needs to fund her play "Fever".    

### Purpose
	The purpose of this project is to analyze the data collected of over four thousand  crowdfunding campaigns and focus in how the launch date and the proposed goal affect the outcomes of these crowdfunding campaigns. With this data we will create tables and charts that will help us understand these factors so we can recommend Louise the best dates and goal expectations that will improve her chances of having a successful campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
  In order to start the analysis of these factors. We created a new column in our data sheet so we could extract the year of the launch date for each campaign by using the function year(). Then we created a pivot table with date created column data as our rows, outcomes as our columns, years and parent category as our filters and count of outcomes as our values.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
